<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MatteCarra/AccA">AccA</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/VR-25/acc">acc</a> and <a
		href="https://github.com/VR-25/djs">djs</a> front-end. Both modules come bundled and are automatically installed
	as needed.</p>

<p>The app is developed with ordinary users in mind. It targets mainly people and aliens alike who feel uncomfortable
	with terminal. ACC and djs commands are still made available, though.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE</strong> read acc's documentation (README) <strong>BEFORE</strong> installing AccA! It's available in
	Markdown and HTML formats from the link above. All <strong>disclaimers</strong> and <strong>warnings</strong> listed
	there apply to this project as well!</p>

<p>If you point your finger at us, because you forgot to do your homework and your home got burned to the ground as a
	result, we'll simply ignore you.</p>

<p>Typically, we don't answer questions that already have well documented answers.</p>
